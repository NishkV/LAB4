# Fish Market ML Model

## Overview

This project deploys a machine learning model on Heroku to predict the weight of fish based on their attributes using the Fish market dataset.

## Features

- Built a regression model using scikit-learn to predict fish weight.
- Created a frontend interface using HTML and CSS for user input.
- Deployed the application on Heroku for online predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the Flask application:
4. 
4. Access the application locally:
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000

## Usage

- Enter the fish attributes (lengths, height, width) into the form on the webpage.
- Click "Predict Weight" to see the predicted weight of the fish.

## Deployment to Heroku

- Connected GitHub repository to Heroku for automatic deployment.
- Access the deployed application at: [Heroku App URL](https://aidi-2004-lab-4-186a7de0230e.herokuapp.com/)

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Flask application script handling model predictions.
- `fish_weight_model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model for fish weight prediction.
- `index.html`, `style.css`: Frontend files for user interface.

## Credits

- The Fish market dataset from Kaggle.
- Flask and scikit-learn documentation for API and model building guidance.
